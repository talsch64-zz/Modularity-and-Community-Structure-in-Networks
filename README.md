# Modularity-and-Community-Structure-in-Networks

Final Project in the course "C project"

In complex networks, a network is said to have community structure if the nodes of the
network can be grouped into groups of nodes with dense connections internally, and sparser
connections between groups.

In this project we have implemented an algorithm for detecting community structures (or
clusters) in a network. The ability to detect such groups is of significant importance.
For example, partitioning a protein-protein interaction network into clusters can provide a
modular view of the network, with different groups of nodes performing different functions
within the cell.

As part of the project, we implemented various algebric and network division algorithms
and different data structures such as sparse matrices for storing the data and modularity matrices
for executing the division algorithms and the different algebric operations.
